# ReactPortfolio

## Description
The goal of this project was to create a portfolio that includes an about section, a project section that shows and links to my work, a contact section, and a resume page as well.

## Key Points
1. Developed a single-page application portfolio using React
2. When the portfolio is loaded, the page contains a header, section for content, and a footer
3. The header contains the developer's name with navigation titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
4. Clicking on navigation title brings user to relevant page
5. Project section contains six of my previous projects with links to both the deployed application and github repository
6. Contact session contains 3 input fields for name, email address, and message, as well as a submit button
7. Resume section contains a downloadable link including my resume
8. The footer has links to my GitHub, linkedIn, and Stack Overflow pages
