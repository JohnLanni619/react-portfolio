## About Me
I'm a Web Developer who specializes in working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I completed the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp in September 2021. Since then, I've been continuing to learn and develop my skills. When I'm not coding, I'm most likely playing video games or spending time with my family.
