                    I'm a Full Stack Web Developer with a passion for technology and continued learning. I 
                    graduated from the Rutgers University Web Development Bootcamp in September 2021. As a former
                    personal training manager, Iâ€™m proficient in working with others and am looking forward to
                    collaborating with other developers to create high quality applications that solve problems and
                    deliver an exceptional user experience.
