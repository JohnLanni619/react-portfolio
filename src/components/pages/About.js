          I'm a Full Stack Web Developer with a passion for technology and
          continued learning. I graduated from the Rutgers University Web
          Development Bootcamp in September 2021. As a former personal training
          manager, Iâ€™m proficient in working with others and am looking forward
          to collaborating with other developers to create high quality
          applications that solve problems and deliver an exceptional user
          experience.
